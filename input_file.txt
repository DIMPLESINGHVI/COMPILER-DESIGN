procedure:
1. We create a text file named "input_file.txt" where the source program is present.
1. We create a user defined function called "isKeyword" to check for keyword and return the value for flag
2. In the main function we create a file pointer to read from the input file.
3. We check whether the character is an operator, keyword or an identifier character by character.
4. We create a count variable and increment it to count the number of tokens in the input file. 
5. We then display the token count.
